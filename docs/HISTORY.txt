Changelog
=========

0.5.1 (2012-11-14)
------------------

- Extended the `Slot` definition by adding a new top interface.
  `ISlot` provides a more generic way to register sub-components on
  a group-like component, the "Slot".

  `IViewSlot` now inherits from `ISlot`.

  Tests have been affected accordingly.


0.5 (2012-05-01)
----------------

- Major update : merged `cromlech.io` to `cromlech.browser`.
  Renamed most components. Be sure to update your code.
  Some API changed : `IView` is now a marker interface and it replaces
  the former `IHTTPRenderer`. `IRenderable` is replacing the
  former `IRenderer`. IResponseFactory has been introduced to
  add an abstraction between a view and its effective response.


0.4.4 (2012-04-28)
------------------

- added ITypedHTTPRequest


0.4.3 (2012-04-27)
------------------

- added client errors exceptions (4xx)


0.4.2 (2012-04-17)
------------------

- added IForm interface


0.4.1 (2012-02-01)
------------------

- redirect_response and redirect_exception_response
  now sets content-length to 0 and content-type to text/plain


0.4 (2012-01-17)
----------------

- `ILayout` is no longer extending `IHTTPRenderer`, but simply `IRenderer`.
  This choice is influenced by the experience in the use of this component
  and does not prevent a `IHTTPRenderer` implementation of an `ILayout`
  component.

- An implementation of a `ILayout` component has been added : `HTTPWrappper`.
  This layout wraps a string into HTML base tags in order to make it more
  likely to have reusable renderers in other layouts.


0.3a1 (2012-01-05)
------------------

- Using now the new definitions from the ``cromlech.io`` split, introducing
  a more specific request and response, respectively : `IHTTPRequest` and 
  `IHTTPResponse`.

- Changed the way a redirection is done : this is no longer a defined
  class method. A new util function is provided to replace it. It creates
  a new response instead of modifying an existing one.


0.2 (2011-12-19)
----------------

- Changed requirements for BeautifulSoup to an existing version


0.1 (2011-07-29)
----------------

- Initial stable release
